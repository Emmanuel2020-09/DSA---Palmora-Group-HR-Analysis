# DSA---Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis
Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, faced public criticism over gender inequality within its workforce. As part of a data-driven response, I was tasked with analyzing the company‚Äôs HR data to uncover gender-related issues across regions and departments.
The analysis focused on:
Gender distribution by department and region
Performance ratings segmented by gender
Gender pay gap at organizational and departmental levels
Compliance with a new regulation requiring a minimum salary of $90,000
Salary distribution in $10,000 bands, visualized by region

After cleaning the dataset (handling missing genders, removing ex-employees, and filtering out null departments), I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key trends and guide HR decisions.

## üîç Key Insights:
Disparities in gender representation across departments and regions
Evidence of a gender pay gap in several units
A notable portion of employees (mostly female) earn below $90,000
High performers are not always well-compensated, suggesting review opportunities

The final dashboard equips Palmoria‚Äôs leadership with the tools to make equity-focused, data-driven decisions and improve organizational fairness.

## Tool Used
PowerBi - For data cleaning and visualization
